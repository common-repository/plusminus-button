The PlusMinus Button is an extension for your WooCommerce Shop. With + / - the number of products can be changed before buying.

== Description ==

Your business works with a WooCommerce shop and you want to expand your shop by a small feature, then the PlusMinus Button is just the right one.

Your customers do not only want to buy just one piece of a product, but rather several. Currently on your Woocommerce Shop, this is usually done via two possible function. With arrows you can increase or decrease the number. Or the shop offers an input field in which the number can be entered.

But the PlusMinus button seems a bit cooler in terms of number. The number can still be entered via keypad. The arrows are replaced by + for a higher number and - for a lower number.

The PlusMinus button can be activated on three different levels. The first option would be to activate the +/- functions on the shop overview page next to the `Add to cart` button. Another option, the PlusMinus Button, can be used at the product level. If your customer looks more closely at a specific product, he can change the number with the PlusMinus button before placing it in the shopping cart. But also shortly before the purchase in the shopping cart the number of products can be changed with + and - again

Cool features:

* easy installation
* Activation on three different shop levels: shop overview page, product level and shopping cart
* responsive
* Facilitated operation +/- instead of arrow keys
* manual entry of the number still possible
* is attached to Add to cart button
